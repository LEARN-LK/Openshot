##  **A. Add Videos to Timeline**

1. Import your video using **Import Files** or drag it into the **Project Files** panel.
2. Drag the video from **Project Files** into a **track on the Timeline** (e.g., Track 1).

##  **B. Trim or Clip a Video**

### Method 1: **Trim by dragging**

* Hover over the **start or end** of a video clip.
* Click and **drag inward** to shorten the clip (trim the edges).

### Method 2: **Clip using Razor Tool**

* Select the **Razor Tool** (scissors icon) from the toolbar.
* Click on the video clip at the point where you want to **split** it.
* You can delete or move each segment individually.

##  **C. Reposition Clips**

* Click and **drag any clip** along the timeline to move it.
* You can **drag clips between tracks** (e.g., move from Track 2 to Track 1).
* Use **snap** (enabled by default) to automatically align clips with precision.

##  **D. Adjust Clip Length**

* Hover over either edge of a clip.
* Drag left or right to **shorten** or **extend** the duration of that clip on the timeline.
* Use the **zoom** slider (below the timeline) to zoom in for precise editing.

5. Adjust the position and duration to sync with the speech or scene.

##  **G. Divide Video into Sections**

1. Use the **Razor Tool** to cut the video into different sections.

   * Move, rearrange, or delete individual sections.
   * Add **transitions** between them (drag from Transitions tab).
   * Apply different effects to each section.

##  **H. Add Images to Video**

1. Import images (PNG, JPG) using the **Import Files** button.
2. Drag the image onto the **Timeline**, typically above the video track (e.g., Track 2 or 3).
3. Adjust the image duration by dragging its ends.
4. Use right-click > **Transform** to resize or reposition the image.
5. Optionally, add effects like fade-in/out or animation with keyframes.
